We believe that knowledge and skill development will open professional opportunities and a path to financial security.

history_pt1: "In August 1999, ADTinc opened its first Internet Training Center in an economically depressed section of Southwest Houston with the help of Stanford Alexander (Chairman, Weingarten Realty Investors), former Mayor Lee Brown and the late Ben Love (Chairman, Texas Commerce Bank). The immense community demand later resulted in the creation of four new computer literacy training sites across Houston.  Those locations include:" 

history_pt2: 
    - the Refugee Alliance Center, which works with immigrants and other low-income, at-risk client populations 
    - the Medhane Alem Church, a place of worship established by Orthodox Ethiopians 
    - East End Center for individuals with disabilities 
    - a site jointly operated by ADTINC, the Alief School District, and Communities-in-Schools. 

history_pt3: The fourth listed satellite program is particularly significant – the local school District had determined that although their elementary and secondary grade students were making impressive strides towards computer literacy, the parents of these children often had few technology skills to speak of.  Accordingly, ADTINC decided to create an inter-generational environment where children and parents could master technology together.
