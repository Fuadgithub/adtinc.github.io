mission: Appropriate Development Technology, Inc. (ADT) is a nonprofit based in Houston, Texas on a mission to close the digital divide. Through technical training, we empower people, of all walks of life, to better their lives. Inside our Internet Learning Centers and Maker Spaces, we introduce emerging technologies and learning resources for career advancement. We believe that knowledge and skill development will open professional opportunities and a path to financial security.

history_pt1: "In August 1999, ADTinc opened its first Internet Training Center in an economically depressed section of Southwest Houston with the help of Stanford Alexander (Chairman, Weingarten Realty Investors), former Mayor Lee Brown and the late Ben Love (Chairman, Texas Commerce Bank). The immense community demand later resulted in the creation of four new computer literacy training sites across Houston.  Those locations include:" 

history_pt2: 
    - the Refugee Alliance Center, which works with immigrants and other low-income, at-risk client populations 
    - the Medhane Alem Church, a place of worship established by Orthodox Ethiopians 
    - East End Center for individuals with disabilities 
    - a site jointly operated by ADTINC, the Alief School District, and Communities-in-Schools. 

history_pt3: The fourth listed satellite program is particularly significant – the local school District had determined that although their elementary and secondary grade students were making impressive strides towards computer literacy, the parents of these children often had few technology skills to speak of.  Accordingly, ADTINC decided to create an inter-generational environment where children and parents could master technology together.

donate_pt1: There is a massive opportunity gap between the children of the poor and the rich.  This gap prevents underpriveleged children from accessing path-changing programs in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). To bridge this gap, we offer STEM and vocational classes to create opportunities.

donate_pt2: Public schools, especially in minority districts, are overwhelmed. Consequently, children from these districts are falling behind in STEM subjects where high paying jobs are being created.

donate_pt3: Research has shown that exposing children at an early age to science and mathematics can inspire them to become future scientists and engineers. Our motto is to encourage underprivileged kids (ages 9-12 years) to better themselves through education and break the cycle of poverty.

newsblurb: Appropriate Development Technology (ADTINC) has been involved in promoting access to technology education to bridge income inequality. The objective of the organization is to provide  access to latest and relevant technology throughout the year in libraries, YMCA and community centers in minority and disadvantaged areas to produce minority engineers and scientists in order to break the cycle of poverty. On this page you can find current and past news articles related to our organization.

what_we_do_1: To bridge income inequality, we offer STEM and vocational classes to disadvantage communities.  

what_we_do_2: We leverage technology and existing resources by offering STEM related education in disadvantaged neighborhood libraries, YMCAs, community centers, churches, parks and technology centers.

what_we_do_3: Our primary focus is to encourage underprivileged kids (9-13) to become future engineers and scientists and to break the cycle of poverty.
